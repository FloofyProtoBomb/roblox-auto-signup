# Roblox auto signup

A tool that auto fetch a temporary email address and creates an account at https://roblox.com/

## How it works

Simple as filling date of birthday, username as well as password all automatically.


## Features

- Be able to prompt to change to your own password instead of using the default one.
- The script does all the job itself
- Automatically checks if the username generated is taken or not. If yes, a new one would be generated.
- Error handling (prob)

> **Warning**
> It is important to note that excessive usage of this tool may result in rate limiting by the API or, in severe cases, IP blocking. To avoid these potential consequences, it is recommended to limit the number of usage. (Maybe 5 times every 10 minutes?)
